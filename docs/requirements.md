  course will be held
- financial data: start and end dates, price of memberships. Records of user subscriptions and history of all payments

## üìã Business Rules

**Client <---> Membership**
A client can have zero or many memberships (for different types of classes and/or at different times).Each membership
belongs to exactly one client and exactly one type of class (ClassType).Memberships store their history by
start_date‚Äìend_date periods and can coexist if they are different types of classes.

**Class Type <---> Membership**
A single class type (ClassType: yoga/sports/pool/etc.) can have zero or many memberships across different clients.Each
membership belongs to one and only one type of class.

**Payment <---> Membership/Client**
A client can make one or many payments.Each payment is made by one and only one client for one specific membership.

**Trainer <---> Qualification (by class type)**
A trainer can have one or more qualifications for different class types.Each qualification record associates exactly one
trainer with exactly one class type.

**Room <---> Allowed Class Types (RoomClassType)**
One room can support multiple class types, and one class type can be available in multiple rooms.Each specific class (
session) can only be assigned to a (room, class_type) pair allowed by the RoomClassType.

**Class (ClassSession)**
Each session is taught by exactly one trainer.A session is conducted in one room and for one class type‚Äîvia a reference
to the (class_type_id, room_id) pair from the RoomClassType. The session's room and activity type must match the allowed
association (otherwise, the activity cannot be created).A session has a capacity limit.

**Attendance**
A client can have zero or more attendance marks.Each mark records the presence of a specific client at a specific
session (composite key (session_id, client_id)).The number of confirmed attendances for a session must not exceed
ClassSession.capacity.

**Trainer <---> Gym ‚Äî placement**
A trainer can be assigned to one or more gyms; a gym has one or more trainers (M:N via fTrainerPlacement).A trainer can
