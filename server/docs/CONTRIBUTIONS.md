# Team Contributions

## Participant 1: Mariia Khorunzha (aka Impelle)

**Implemented functionality:**

- Designed and implemented full functionality for the **Gym**, **Room**, **ClassType**, and **Attendance** modules, including database schema, routing, controllers, services, and repositories.

- Implemented complete **CRUD operations** for gyms, rooms, class types, and attendances with proper input validation and consistent error handling.

- Implemented a **soft delete mechanism** for both main and linking entities, preserving historical data and ensuring referential integrity.

- Developed a **complex transactional workflow** for room creation together with class type bindings and session configuration within a single database transaction, guaranteeing atomicity and data consistency.

- Implemented multiple **analytical and filtered queries**, including:
  - gym utilization and occupancy analysis based on room capacity and active attendances,
  - room search with filtering by capacity range and gym,
  - gym search by address with pagination and sorting,
  - session capacity conflict detection when updating room capacity,
  - retrieval of class types with usage statistics (memberships, qualifications, sessions).
  - room revenue analysis: calculates revenue generated by each room based on session attendance and class prices,
  - class-type revenue analysis: aggregates revenue for each class type based on the number of sessions and prices associated with memberships.

- Wrote **integration and unit tests** for the **Gym**, **Room**, **ClassType**, and **Attendance** modules, covering both core business logic and edge cases.

- Implemented and configured a **global error handling middleware** with support for custom application-level errors.

- Created reusable **utility modules**, including centralized custom error handling (AppError), Prisma error handling utilities, and asynchronous controller wrappers.

- Partially completed project documentation, including the database schema description (`schema.md`, `README.md`, `APIs.md`).

## Participant 2: Anna Kuts (aka AnnKuts)

- Designed and implemented full functionality for the **Clients**, **Memberships**, **Payments** modules, including database schema, routing, controllers, services, and repositories.

- Implemented complete **CRUD operations** for clients, memberships, and payments with proper input validation and consistent error handling.

- Implemented `auth` and `email` services, as well as the registration and authentication logic: input validation, password hashing, token generation and verification, email confirmation, and password recovery.

- Configure test environment

## Participant 2: Vladyslav Mykhailov (aka taitami)

**Implemented functionality:**

- Designed and implemented full functionality for the **Trainers** and **Sessions** modules, including database schema adaptation, complex routing, controllers, services, and repositories.

- Implemented a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** middleware system (`requireAdmin`, `requireTrainerRole`, `requireTrainerOwnerOrAdmin`), ensuring secure resource access where users can only manage their own data unless they hold administrative privileges.

- Implemented complete **CRUD operations** for trainers and class sessions with strict **Zod validation** schemas for request bodies and route parameters.

- Developed a **transactional creation workflow for Trainers**, which simultaneously handles the creation of the trainer entity, their contact data, gym placements, and professional qualifications in a single atomic operation.

- Implemented **deep logical validation for Session creation**, ensuring business rule compliance by verifying:
  - if the selected room supports the specific class type,
  - if the trainer possesses the required qualification for the class type,
  - if the trainer is officially assigned to the gym where the room is located.

- Implemented a **soft delete mechanism** for trainers and sessions, preserving historical data for future analytics and reporting.

- Implemented multiple **analytical and statistical queries**, including:
  - **Top Trainer analysis:** identifies the most productive trainer based on session count over the last month,
  - **Trainer Popularity ranking:** calculates popularity based on the total number of client attendances across all sessions,
  - **Workload Statistics:** provides a detailed breakdown of sessions conducted by a specific trainer, grouped by class type.

- Integrated **JWT-based authentication** extraction into the controller layer to securely bind operations to the currently logged-in user (e.g., ensuring trainers can only create sessions for themselves).
